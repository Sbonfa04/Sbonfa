Hello, I'm Samuele, and I'm studying computer science in Milan. 📖
I'm delving into the world of programming and trying to learn as much as I can. 👨‍💻
Currently, I only know a bit of Go and C++, but I'm curious to learn as many languages as possible.
If I can be of any help with a project, feel free to reach out to me!
